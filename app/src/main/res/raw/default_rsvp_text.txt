## 🧠 The Science

Gamma brainwaves (30-100Hz) represent the brain's highest-frequency oscillations, associated with peak cognitive performance, heightened awareness, and integrated neural processing. Emerging research demonstrates that external 40Hz sensory stimulation can entrain endogenous gamma oscillations, potentially modulating consciousness, memory, and perception.

### Key Research Areas

**Alzheimer's Disease & Cognitive Decline**
- Tsai et al. (2019) demonstrated that 40Hz audiovisual stimulation reduced amyloid plaques and improved cognitive function in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease ([Nature, 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1333-6))
- Human trials have shown promising results in mild cognitive impairment patients (Clements-Cortes et al., 2016)
- The GENUS approach targets specific brain regions through precise sensory timing

**Memory Enhancement**
- Gamma oscillations correlate with memory encoding and retrieval (Herrmann et al., 2010)
- Phase-locked gamma activity may strengthen synaptic connections during learning
- Theta-gamma coupling (6Hz + 40Hz) plays a role in memory consolidation during REM sleep

**Neural Synchronization**
- 40Hz stimulation may promote synchronized neural firing across brain regions
- Enhanced gamma power correlates with improved attention and perceptual binding
- Isoluminant flicker (chromatic changes without brightness changes) provides safer long-term exposure

**Sleep & Circadian Rhythms**
- Binaural beats and brown noise may influence sleep architecture
- Gradual frequency ramps (8Hz→1Hz) align with natural sleep transition patterns
- Auditory entrainment shows promise for improving sleep quality

### Theoretical Mechanisms

**Frequency Following Response (FFR)**
- The brain's natural tendency to synchronize neural oscillations to external rhythmic stimuli
- Most pronounced in visual and auditory cortices
- May propagate to deeper brain structures through thalamocortical circuits

**Resonance & Harmonic Coupling**
- Theta (4-8Hz) and gamma (30-100Hz) waves naturally couple during memory tasks
- 40Hz may act as a harmonic frequency for neural network optimization
- Cross-frequency coupling coordinates activity across brain regions

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Master-Slave Timing Pattern

The audio hardware clock serves as the **single source of truth** for all timing:

- **Master (Audio)**: `GammaAudioEngine` wraps `AudioTrack`, consuming samples at 48kHz sample rate
- **Slave (Video)**: `GammaRenderer` queries audio engine for current 40Hz phase and renders accordingly
- **Zero Drift**: Video never uses system time - only audio phase determines visual output

### Layer Separation

- **Domain Layer**: Pure Kotlin signal math with no Android dependencies
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Android-specific implementations (audio, rendering, display management)
- **UI Layer**: Material Design 3 components with theme-aware styling

### Key Constraints

- **Frame Time P99**: < 8.5ms (required for 120Hz stability)
- **Audio Frequency Accuracy**: 40.0Hz ±0.05Hz
- **A/V Drift Tolerance**: < 10ms over 60-minute session
- **Isoluminant Flicker**: Chrominance modulation only (epilepsy safety)
