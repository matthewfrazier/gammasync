# Create custom subagents

> Create and use specialized AI subagents in Claude Code for task-specific workflows and improved context management.

Subagents are specialized AI assistants that handle specific types of tasks. Each subagent runs in its own context window with a custom system prompt, specific tool access, and independent permissions. When Claude encounters a task that matches a subagent's description, it delegates to that subagent, which works independently and returns results.

Subagents help you:

* **Preserve context** by keeping exploration and implementation out of your main conversation
* **Enforce constraints** by limiting which tools a subagent can use
* **Reuse configurations** across projects with user-level subagents
* **Specialize behavior** with focused system prompts for specific domains
* **Control costs** by routing tasks to faster, cheaper models like Haiku

Claude uses each subagent's description to decide when to delegate tasks. When you create a subagent, write a clear description so Claude knows when to use it.

Claude Code includes several built-in subagents like **Explore**, **Plan**, and **general-purpose**. You can also create custom subagents to handle specific tasks. This page covers the [built-in subagents](#built-in-subagents), [how to create your own](#quickstart-create-your-first-subagent), [full configuration options](#configure-subagents), [patterns for working with subagents](#work-with-subagents), and [example subagents](#example-subagents).

## Built-in subagents

Claude Code includes built-in subagents that Claude automatically uses when appropriate. Each inherits the parent conversation's permissions with additional tool restrictions.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Explore">
    A fast, read-only agent optimized for searching and analyzing codebases.

    * **Model**: Haiku (fast, low-latency)
    * **Tools**: Read-only tools (denied access to Write and Edit tools)
    * **Purpose**: File discovery, code search, codebase exploration

    Claude delegates to Explore when it needs to search or understand a codebase without making changes. This keeps exploration results out of your main conversation context.

    When invoking Explore, Claude specifies a thoroughness level: **quick** for targeted lookups, **medium** for balanced exploration, or **very thorough** for comprehensive analysis.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Plan">
    A research agent used during [plan mode](/en/common-workflows#use-plan-mode-for-safe-code-analysis) to gather context before presenting a plan.

    * **Model**: Inherits from main conversation
    * **Tools**: Read-only tools (denied access to Write and Edit tools)
    * **Purpose**: Codebase research for planning

    When you're in plan mode and Claude needs to understand your codebase, it delegates research to the Plan subagent. This prevents infinite nesting (subagents cannot spawn other subagents) while still gathering necessary context.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="General-purpose">
    A capable agent for complex, multi-step tasks that require both exploration and action.

    * **Model**: Inherits from main conversation
    * **Tools**: All tools
    * **Purpose**: Complex research, multi-step operations, code modifications

    Claude delegates to general-purpose when the task requires both exploration and modification, complex reasoning to interpret results, or multiple dependent steps.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Other">
    Claude Code includes additional helper agents for specific tasks. These are typically invoked automatically, so you don't need to use them directly.

    | Agent             | Model    | When Claude uses it                                      |
    | :---------------- | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Bash              | Inherits | Running terminal commands in a separate context          |
    | statusline-setup  | Sonnet   | When you run `/statusline` to configure your status line |
    | Claude Code Guide | Haiku    | When you ask questions about Claude Code features        |
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Beyond these built-in subagents, you can create your own with custom prompts, tool restrictions, permission modes, hooks, and skills. The following sections show how to get started and customize subagents.

## Quickstart: create your first subagent

Subagents are defined in Markdown files with YAML frontmatter. You can [create them manually](#write-subagent-files) or use the `/agents` command.

This walkthrough guides you through creating a user-level subagent with the `/agent` command. The subagent reviews code and suggests improvements for the codebase.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the subagents interface">
    In Claude Code, run:

    ```
    /agents
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a new user-level agent">
    Select **Create new agent**, then choose **User-level**. This saves the subagent to `~/.claude/agents/` so it's available in all your projects.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate with Claude">
    Select **Generate with Claude**. When prompted, describe the subagent:

    ```
    A code improvement agent that scans files and suggests improvements
    for readability, performance, and best practices. It should explain
    each issue, show the current code, and provide an improved version.
    ```

    Claude generates the system prompt and configuration. Press `e` to open it in your editor if you want to customize it.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select tools">
    For a read-only reviewer, deselect everything except **Read-only tools**. If you keep all tools selected, the subagent inherits all tools available to the main conversation.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select model">
    Choose which model the subagent uses. For this example agent, select **Sonnet**, which balances capability and speed for analyzing code patterns.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose a color">
    Pick a background color for the subagent. This helps you identify which subagent is running in the UI.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save and try it out">
    Save the subagent. It's available immediately (no restart needed). Try it:

    ```
    Use the code-improver agent to suggest improvements in this project
    ```

    Claude delegates to your new subagent, which scans the codebase and returns improvement suggestions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

You now have a subagent you can use in any project on your machine to analyze codebases and suggest improvements.

You can also create subagents manually as Markdown files, define them via CLI flags, or distribute them through plugins. The following sections cover all configuration options.

## Configure subagents

### Use the /agents command

The `/agents` command provides an interactive interface for managing subagents. Run `/agents` to:

* View all available subagents (built-in, user, project, and plugin)
* Create new subagents with guided setup or Claude generation
* Edit existing subagent configuration and tool access
* Delete custom subagents
* See which subagents are active when duplicates exist

This is the recommended way to create and manage subagents. For manual creation or automation, you can also add subagent files directly.

### Choose the subagent scope

Subagents are Markdown files with YAML frontmatter. Store them in different locations depending on scope. When multiple subagents share the same name, the higher-priority location wins.

| Location                     | Scope                   | Priority    | How to create                         |
| :--------------------------- | :---------------------- | :---------- | :------------------------------------ |
| `--agents` CLI flag          | Current session         | 1 (highest) | Pass JSON when launching Claude Code  |
| `.claude/agents/`            | Current project         | 2           | Interactive or manual                 |
| `~/.claude/agents/`          | All your projects       | 3           | Interactive or manual                 |
| Plugin's `agents/` directory | Where plugin is enabled | 4 (lowest)  | Installed with [plugins](/en/plugins) |

**Project subagents** (`.claude/agents/`) are ideal for subagents specific to a codebase. Check them into version control so your team can use and improve them collaboratively.

**User subagents** (`~/.claude/agents/`) are personal subagents available in all your projects.

**CLI-defined subagents** are passed as JSON when launching Claude Code. They exist only for that session and aren't saved to disk, making them useful for quick testing or automation scripts:

```bash  theme={null}
claude --agents '{
  "code-reviewer": {
    "description": "Expert code reviewer. Use proactively after code changes.",
    "prompt": "You are a senior code reviewer. Focus on code quality, security, and best practices.",
    "tools": ["Read", "Grep", "Glob", "Bash"],
    "model": "sonnet"
  }
}'
```

The `--agents` flag accepts JSON with the same fields as [frontmatter](#supported-frontmatter-fields). Use `prompt` for the system prompt (equivalent to the markdown body in file-based subagents). See the [CLI reference](/en/cli-reference#agents-flag-format) for the full JSON format.

**Plugin subagents** come from [plugins](/en/plugins) you've installed. They appear in `/agents` alongside your custom subagents. See the [plugin components reference](/en/plugins-reference#agents) for details on creating plugin subagents.

### Write subagent files

Subagent files use YAML frontmatter for configuration, followed by the system prompt in Markdown:

<Note>
  Subagents are loaded at session start. If you create a subagent by manually adding a file, restart your session or use `/agents` to load it immediately.
</Note>

```markdown  theme={null}
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Reviews code for quality and best practices
tools: Read, Glob, Grep
model: sonnet
---

You are a code reviewer. When invoked, analyze the code and provide
specific, actionable feedback on quality, security, and best practices.
```

The frontmatter defines the subagent's metadata and configuration. The body becomes the system prompt that guides the subagent's behavior. Subagents receive only this system prompt (plus basic environment details like working directory), not the full Claude Code system prompt.

#### Supported frontmatter fields

The following fields can be used in the YAML frontmatter. Only `name` and `description` are required.

| Field             | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| :---------------- | :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`            | Yes      | Unique identifier using lowercase letters and hyphens                                                                                                                                                        |
| `description`     | Yes      | When Claude should delegate to this subagent                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `tools`           | No       | [Tools](#available-tools) the subagent can use. Inherits all tools if omitted                                                                                                                                |
| `disallowedTools` | No       | Tools to deny, removed from inherited or specified list                                                                                                                                                      |
| `model`           | No       | [Model](#choose-a-model) to use: `sonnet`, `opus`, `haiku`, or `inherit`. Defaults to `inherit`                                                                                                              |
| `permissionMode`  | No       | [Permission mode](#permission-modes): `default`, `acceptEdits`, `dontAsk`, `bypassPermissions`, or `plan`                                                                                                    |
| `skills`          | No       | [Skills](/en/skills) to load into the subagent's context at startup. The full skill content is injected, not just made available for invocation. Subagents don't inherit skills from the parent conversation |
| `hooks`           | No       | [Lifecycle hooks](#define-hooks-for-subagents) scoped to this subagent                                                                                                                                       |

### Choose a model

The `model` field controls which [AI model](/en/model-config) the subagent uses:

* **Model alias**: Use one of the available aliases: `sonnet`, `opus`, or `haiku`
* **inherit**: Use the same model as the main conversation
* **Omitted**: If not specified, defaults to `inherit` (uses the same model as the main conversation)

### Control subagent capabilities

You can control what subagents can do through tool access, permission modes, and conditional rules.

#### Available tools

Subagents can use any of Claude Code's [internal tools](/en/settings#tools-available-to-claude). By default, subagents inherit all tools from the main conversation, including MCP tools.

To restrict tools, use the `tools` field (allowlist) or `disallowedTools` field (denylist):

```yaml  theme={null}
---
name: safe-researcher
description: Research agent with restricted capabilities
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash
disallowedTools: Write, Edit
---
```

#### Permission modes

The `permissionMode` field controls how the subagent handles permission prompts. Subagents inherit the permission context from the main conversation but can override the mode.

| Mode                | Behavior                                                           |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `default`           | Standard permission checking with prompts                          |
| `acceptEdits`       | Auto-accept file edits                                             |
| `dontAsk`           | Auto-deny permission prompts (explicitly allowed tools still work) |
| `bypassPermissions` | Skip all permission checks                                         |
| `plan`              | Plan mode (read-only exploration)                                  |

<Warning>
  Use `bypassPermissions` with caution. It skips all permission checks, allowing the subagent to execute any operation without approval.
</Warning>

If the parent uses `bypassPermissions`, this takes precedence and cannot be overridden.

#### Preload skills into subagents

Use the `skills` field to inject skill content into a subagent's context at startup. This gives the subagent domain knowledge without requiring it to discover and load skills during execution.

```yaml  theme={null}
---
name: api-developer
description: Implement API endpoints following team conventions
skills:
  - api-conventions
  - error-handling-patterns
---

Implement API endpoints. Follow the conventions and patterns from the preloaded skills.
```

The full content of each skill is injected into the subagent's context, not just made available for invocation. Subagents don't inherit skills from the parent conversation; you must list them explicitly.

<Note>
  This is the inverse of [running a skill in a subagent](/en/skills#run-skills-in-a-subagent). With `skills` in a subagent, the subagent controls the system prompt and loads skill content. With `context: fork` in a skill, the skill content is injected into the agent you specify. Both use the same underlying system.
</Note>

#### Conditional rules with hooks

For more dynamic control over tool usage, use `PreToolUse` hooks to validate operations before they execute. This is useful when you need to allow some operations of a tool while blocking others.

This example creates a subagent that only allows read-only database queries. The `PreToolUse` hook runs the script specified in `command` before each Bash command executes:

```yaml  theme={null}
---
name: db-reader
description: Execute read-only database queries
tools: Bash
hooks:
  PreToolUse:
    - matcher: "Bash"
      hooks:
        - type: command
          command: "./scripts/validate-readonly-query.sh"
---
```

Claude Code [passes hook input as JSON](/en/hooks#pretooluse-input) via stdin to hook commands. The validation script reads this JSON, extracts the Bash command, and [exits with code 2](/en/hooks#exit-code-2-behavior) to block write operations:

```bash  theme={null}
#!/bin/bash
# ./scripts/validate-readonly-query.sh

INPUT=$(cat)
COMMAND=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.tool_input.command // empty')

# Block SQL write operations (case-insensitive)
if echo "$COMMAND" | grep -iE '\b(INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE|DROP|CREATE|ALTER|TRUNCATE)\b' > /dev/null; then
  echo "Blocked: Only SELECT queries are allowed" >&2
  exit 2
fi

exit 0
```

See [Hook input](/en/hooks#pretooluse-input) for the complete input schema and [exit codes](/en/hooks#simple-exit-code) for how exit codes affect behavior.

#### Disable specific subagents

You can prevent Claude from using specific subagents by adding them to the `deny` array in your [settings](/en/settings#permission-settings). Use the format `Task(subagent-name)` where `subagent-name` matches the subagent's name field.

```json  theme={null}
{
  "permissions": {
    "deny": ["Task(Explore)", "Task(my-custom-agent)"]
  }
}
```

This works for both built-in and custom subagents. You can also use the `--disallowedTools` CLI flag:

```bash  theme={null}
claude --disallowedTools "Task(Explore)"
```

See [IAM documentation](/en/iam#tool-specific-permission-rules) for more details on permission rules.

### Define hooks for subagents

Subagents can define [hooks](/en/hooks) that run during the subagent's lifecycle. There are two ways to configure hooks:

1. **In the subagent's frontmatter**: Define hooks that run only while that subagent is active
2. **In `settings.json`**: Define hooks that run in the main session when subagents start or stop

#### Hooks in subagent frontmatter

Define hooks directly in the subagent's markdown file. These hooks only run while that specific subagent is active and are cleaned up when it finishes.

| Event         | Matcher input | When it fires                   |
| :------------ | :------------ | :------------------------------ |
| `PreToolUse`  | Tool name     | Before the subagent uses a tool |
| `PostToolUse` | Tool name     | After the subagent uses a tool  |
| `Stop`        | (none)        | When the subagent finishes      |

This example validates Bash commands with the `PreToolUse` hook and runs a linter after file edits with `PostToolUse`:

```yaml  theme={null}
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Review code changes with automatic linting
hooks:
  PreToolUse:
    - matcher: "Bash"
      hooks:
        - type: command
          command: "./scripts/validate-command.sh $TOOL_INPUT"
  PostToolUse:
    - matcher: "Edit|Write"
      hooks:
        - type: command
          command: "./scripts/run-linter.sh"
---
```

`Stop` hooks in frontmatter are automatically converted to `SubagentStop` events.

#### Project-level hooks for subagent events

Configure hooks in `settings.json` that respond to subagent lifecycle events in the main session. Use the `matcher` field to target specific agent types by name.

| Event           | Matcher input   | When it fires                    |
| :-------------- | :-------------- | :--------------------
